# Flux Authentication System Checkpoints Completion

## Checkpoint 2.2: OAuth Providers Setup ✅

We have successfully implemented the OAuth provider integration for Flux, allowing users to authenticate using GitHub and Google accounts. The implementation includes:

### GitHub OAuth Integration
- Created GitHub OAuth initialization endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/oauth/github`)
- Implemented callback handler for GitHub authentication (`/api/v1/auth/oauth/github/callback`)
- Added support for account linking via GitHub

### Google OAuth Integration
- Created Google OAuth initialization endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/oauth/google`)
- Implemented callback handler for Google authentication (`/api/v1/auth/oauth/google/callback`)
- Added support for account linking via Google

### OAuth Provider Configurations
- Defined reusable OAuth provider configurations for GitHub and Google
- Implemented utility functions to manage OAuth providers
- Added support for provider-specific scopes and customization

### OAuth Account Linking
- Implemented account linking endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/oauth/link-provider`)
- Created account unlinking endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/oauth/unlink-provider`)
- Added security checks to prevent removing the last authentication method

### Multi-Provider Support
- Added support for users to have multiple linked OAuth providers
- Implemented provider information storage in user profiles
- Ensured seamless user experience across different authentication methods

## Checkpoint 2.3: User Data Synchronization ✅

We have successfully implemented the user data synchronization between Supabase Auth and Railway PostgreSQL database, ensuring user data consistency:

### Supabase Edge Functions Setup
- Created auth-sync Edge Function to forward auth events
- Implemented secure webhook handling with proper authentication
- Added CORS support and error handling
- Set up environment variable configuration for Edge Functions

### User Sync to Railway PostgreSQL
- Implemented webhook handler to process auth events
- Created user synchronization service to map Supabase users to Railway DB
- Added support for syncing OAuth provider information
- Ensured data consistency across both databases

### User Profile Management
- Set up automatic user profile creation for new users
- Implemented profile update synchronization
- Added support for provider-specific profile fields (GitHub username, Google profile ID)

### Auth Webhook Handler
- Created robust webhook handler for all auth events (user.created, user.updated, etc.)
- Implemented proper error handling and logging
- Added security with webhook signature verification

### User Tables in Railway Database
- Verified and utilized existing user table schema
- Confirmed proper database migration setup
- Ensured schema supports OAuth provider information

## Deployment and Testing

To deploy and test the OAuth and user synchronization:

1. Run the deployment script for the Supabase Edge Function:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-auth-sync.sh
   ```

2. Set up environment variables in Railway:
   ```bash
   railway variables set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
   railway variables set GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
   railway variables set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   railway variables set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   railway variables set WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   ```

3. Configure the OAuth providers in Supabase dashboard

4. Test the OAuth flow using the endpoints:
   - GitHub authentication: `/api/v1/auth/oauth/github`
   - Google authentication: `/api/v1/auth/oauth/google`
   - Provider linking: `/api/v1/auth/oauth/link-provider`

5. Monitor user synchronization in the logs

## Next Steps

With Checkpoints 2.2 and 2.3 completed, we're ready to move on to Phase 3: Core API Layer, which includes:

1. Implementing expense management APIs
2. Building group management system
3. Developing core services layer
